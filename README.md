# AI Research Analyst Application

## 1. Project Vision & Objective

As an AI Product Manager at [INVESTMENT FIRM], the vision is to design and build a cutting-edge **AI Research Application** for the Equities department. This application aims to solve real business problems for investment professionals and research analysts by:

- **Saving Time:** Automating data gathering, processing, and initial analysis.
- **Improving Investment Decision-Making:** Providing timely, relevant, and deep insights.
- **Gathering Accurate Insights:** Leveraging AI to uncover patterns and information from diverse data sources.

This AI Research Assistant will empower researchers to perform high-level and in-depth analysis on US-listed companies efficiently and effectively.

## 2. Core Problem Statement

Investment professionals and research analysts are inundated with vast amounts of financial data, news, and company disclosures. Manually sifting through this information to derive actionable insights is time-consuming and prone to oversight. There's a critical need for an intelligent system that can:

- Quickly answer fundamental questions about companies.
- Aggregate and synthesize information from public and proprietary sources.
- Proactively identify relevant insights and trends.
- Explain complex market movements.

## 3. Current MVP Functionality

The current Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the AI Research Assistant allows researchers to ask basic questions about US-listed companies, such as:

- "What is the latest stock price for Apple?" (Fetches real-time data)
- "What are the latest related announcements for Meta?" (Currently uses placeholder/simulated news and announcements, with AI summarization)
- "What are the reasons for Tesla's stock price movements in the last 2 weeks?" (Analyzes historical price data and placeholder news/announcements using AI)

Information sources for the MVP primarily include public market data (via Yahoo Finance for MVP) and simulated news, with AI processing handled by OpenAI models.

## 4. Proposed Features List & Prioritization
